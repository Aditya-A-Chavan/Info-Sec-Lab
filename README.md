A comprehensive collection of information and network security algorithms implemented in a client-server architecture. This repository serves as both a learning resource and a practical toolkit for developers and security enthusiasts.

This repository covers implementations and examples from the following major topics:

1. Basics of Cryptography
2. Classification of Cipher Algorithms
3. Access Control
4. Software Security
5. Network and Web Security



## Client-Server Architecture
  Algorithms implemented in a client-server architecture. Tested with multiple systems lying on the same Network

## üîç Topics Covered

### 1. Basics of Cryptography

- Transposition ciphers (Row, Column, Double)
- Substitution ciphers (Mono-alphabetic, Polyalphabetic)
- Historical ciphers (Shift, Multiplicative, Affine, Playfair, Vigen√®re)

### 2. Classification of Cipher Algorithms
- Stream Ciphers (RC4, A5/1)
- Block Ciphers (DES, AES)
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- Asymmetric key cryptography (RSA)
- Cryptographic Hash Functions (MD5, SHA-1)
- Digital Signatures

### 3. Access Control
- Authentication methods and protocols
- Authorization models
- Kerberos and Zero-Knowledge Proof
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)

### 4. Software Security
- Buffer Overflow
- Race Conditions
- Malware analysis

### 5. Network and Web Security
- TCP/IP vulnerabilities
- Network attacks (Session Hijacking, ARP Spoofing, DoS)
- Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems
- SSL/TLS and IPSec protocols


7. **Intrusion Detection**
   - Signature-based IDS
   - Anomaly-based IDS
